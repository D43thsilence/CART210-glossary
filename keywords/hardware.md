## Hardware

Hardware is the physical or mechanical equipment that is essential for accomplishing an activity or that is made for a specific purpose. Originally reserved for primary materials used for repair and construction, this term is also often used in conjunction with computers to describe the physical parts that compose it, such as the CPU, the motherboard, the [GPU](#gpu.md), and more, as a way to separate them from the instructions that they run, which are referred to as [software](#software.md). Also, just like with construction materials, the quality of hardware can affect the performance of a computer. The higher the quality, the better the performance, and vice versa. But older or lower quality hardware can still perform relatively well by maximizing their efficiency, which is referred to as optimization.

Knowledge surrounding computer hardware is often associated with architecture and organization due to the modular nature of a computer. Computer architecture being an abstract view of the computer, defining it by its capabilities and programming model. While Computer organization focuses on the physical connections and relationships between the parts of the computer, so the circuitry [^Clemens06Hardware].

While computer hardware is usually distinguished from software, software cannot be designed without understanding hardware and hardware cannot be designed without understanding software. The designing process of hardware must always consider how software is designed because it must enable it to make use of the necessary input/output devices and computer hardware to run properly, the ability to connect to external devices correctly if needed, and the hardware’s architecture must be able to understand process the software’s code [^Castoulis05Hardware].
